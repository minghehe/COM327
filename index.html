<p>My name is Minghe, Hu. I came form China. I am a senior communications major student. This is my second semester in IIT. </p>

<p>I enjoy the uncertainty that different places bring to me. Including USA, I‘ve been 14 countries. In Europe, I travelled alone. Passing through plazas, walking through crowded streets, and waiting for the train in empty station. Traveling alone make me live in the moment. Loneliness not only taught me to cherish the time with family and friends, but also taught me open myself.</p>

<p>I studied in China, in Spain, in US. Although culture diversity made me panic sometimes, I enjoy the differences from people’s value and custom. I learned to accept and understand people from   diversity cultural background. It’s like reading different books. </p>

<p>To be a journalist is always been my dream. Diversity of knowledge and broad cultural visual is what I need. Getting to know how a web is designed is from my interests and the necessity from my future profession need. This course will be challenge for me. However, life is full of uncertainty. Challenge would just be another station. </p>
