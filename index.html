I grow up in a dessert area. Blue sky and loess are the thing I remember most from that place. 
After I grow up, I never saw something’s color is so pretty as the blue and brown I saw during my childhood.
From the place can’t even be found in Chinese map, I moved to cities where I never saw blue sky for one day.

I got used to live in different cities, thus it didn’t make me hesitated when I got the chance to go to Spain. 
On the coast of Mediterranean, I learned that there’s other beauties in the other world. 
More important is that I want to know them.
